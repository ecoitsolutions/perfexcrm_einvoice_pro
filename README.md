### Configuration Fields Explained

Here is an explanation of each setting and why it's needed for the e-factura XML file.

#### XML Output Language
* **XML Generation Language:** This dropdown controls the language of the notes included in the final XML file. You can have your PerfexCRM interface in English but generate an XML with notes in Romanian, or vice-versa.

#### Company Details
* **Company Registration Number:** This field is **required** by the e-factura standard and is configured **directly on this settings page**. You should enter your company's registration number from the Trade Register (e.g., `J12/1234/1999`). This value populates the following tag in the XML:
    ```xml
    <cac:PartyLegalEntity>
        <cbc:CompanyID>J12/1234/1999</cbc:CompanyID>
    </cac:PartyLegalEntity>
    ```
    *Note: This is different from the `VAT Number`, which is configured in the standard PerfexCRM settings (`Setup -> Settings -> Company Information`).*

* **Social Capital (numeric value only):** Enter the numeric value of your company's social capital (e.g., `200`). The module will automatically prepend the text "Capital social: " to the value in the XML file.

#### Bank Details
* **IBAN Account:** Enter the IBAN where you wish to receive payments for the invoice.
* **Bank Name:** Enter the name of your bank. These fields populate the `<cac:PaymentMeans>` block in the XML.

#### Invoice Notes
These dropdowns allow you to select up to three predefined notes to be included in the XML file. The text of these notes is automatically translated based on the **XML Generation Language** you selected above.

* You can choose a predefined note from each dropdown.
* To omit a note, simply select **"None"**.

After configuring all the fields, click the **Save Settings** button. The module is now ready to use!
